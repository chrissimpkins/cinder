## Cindercone

Cindercone is a [Cinder](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder) clone. Cinder
is a clean, responsive [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) static documentation site
generator theme. Cindercone is a collection of changes intended to improve and
tailor Cinder for my particular use-case.

All credit goes to Chris Simpkins for the great original Cinder theme. Thanks!

## Changes from Cinder

+ Fixes all the deprecation warnings in recent versions of mkdocs.
+ Focus is automatically set on the search input box.
+ The footer has been fixed to not encroach on the sidenav TOC.
+ The sidenav TOC shows page heirachy up to three levels deep, instead of
  sections within the current page.
+ Support for repository links to editable pages.

The sidenav TOC change is related to an organizational structure for my own
documentation which is a deeper structure of relatively short pages. So, instead
of showing headings in the current page like Cinder, this theme shows all the
pages, essentially duplicating the structure available in the navbar.
